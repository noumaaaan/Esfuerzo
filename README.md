### What is this repository for? ###

This is an application that I developed in my final year at University from January - May 2017. I have rceently re-involved myself into the project to try and refine my skills, improve this application and potentially deploy to the appstore. 
The application is designed for University students and allows users to create a timetable, track their assignments and stay on top of their studies.
